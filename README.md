# hello_world
My maiden voyage in the world of programming
I am a 32 year old Greek guy who currently works at a school as part-time teacher and university counselor. I like to play video games, dungeons and dragons, card games, I occassionally also read books and exercise. I lived in China for 3.5 years, where I taught english as a second language. I consider that to be among my best achievement, and I draw a lot of my self-worth from it. I get anxious socially, which is amongst my biggest day-to-day obstacles. I got married last month to my partner, whom I met in China. Today is her birthday. 

I am optimistic about the future. I am seeking to train for a teaching license next year, to expand what is available around the world. I am currently in therapy and that gives me hope as well. I recently have become more hopeful overall, believing in the world's and my capacity to heal and overcome the challenges which have at other times seemed monumental.

I got on Github because a friend of my wive's told me that this is the best way for someone to get into the tech industry.
